# Unexpected Output in Hack Function Composition

This repository demonstrates an unexpected output issue encountered when composing functions in Hack. The functions `foo`, `bar`, and `baz` are designed to perform simple arithmetic operations, but the final output deviates from the expected value.

The bug is characterized by an incorrect result when composing these three functions. The expected value is 10, but the actual output is 11, indicating a potential error in the function composition or type inference.

The solution to this bug is provided in `bugSolution.hack`. This solution corrects the issue and produces the expected output.
